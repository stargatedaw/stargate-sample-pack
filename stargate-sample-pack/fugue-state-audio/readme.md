
Fugue State Audio - Stargate DAW Sample Pack
--------------------------------------------

A selection of completely free, public domain sounds from Fugue State Audio for inclusion with the Stargate DAW sample pack.

/drums

There are 5 kits in the drums folder, broken into drum types as per the Stargate DAW standard. These are all electronic sounds generated via synthesis (as opposed to acoustic, recorded sounds). The kit that a given sound belongs to is given in the filename, though one should also feel free to mix and match as they see fit.


/found-sounds

These are sounds from various household objects (and in one instance, nature), recorded with microphones.


/guitar-fx

These are sounds recorded from an Ibanez 7-string electric guitar, processed with virtual effects and amp sims. Though the source is mono, these are layered stereo sounds. In the case of tuned sounds, note names are given.


/loops

A small collection of (mostly percussive) loops, with BPM in the name.


/synth-fx

A few synthetic sound effects.
